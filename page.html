Even though the Bengal tiger is larger in the wild, the Siberian tiger often grows to be larger than the Bengal in captivity, making it the largest purebred cat in the world. </div>

If it’s white with black stripes and has blue eyes, this coloration is caused by a genetic mutation called leucism and is specific to the Bengal tiger. Both parents must have the gene for a white cub to occur. It’s rare, however, only resulting in one out of 10,000 births.</div>

Because it lives only on an island, it has been isolated from other tigers. This has resulted in genetics that are different from its “mainland” cousins. The Sumatran is a critically endangered species. Two other tiger subspecies, the Bali tiger and the Javan tiger, once occupied the same area but are now extinct.</div>
